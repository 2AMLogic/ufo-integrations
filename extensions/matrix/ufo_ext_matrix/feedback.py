"""What a room shows while a turn runs: the member's message read, and the bot typing until the turn
ends.

None of this is delivery. The hub is lossy, so a frame that never arrives costs a typing indicator
and never a turn's answer, and every call here is best effort: a homeserver that refuses one is
logged by error class and the turn goes on. Typing carries the homeserver's own timeout and is
refreshed under it, so a tail that drops ends the indicator on the server's clock rather than leaving
a room typing forever; the terminal or parked frame ends it at once."""
