"""The Matrix surface: a bot user's `/sync` stream in, and the room messages a turn becomes.

A room is a conversation, keyed by its room id; its speakers are members where one resolves. The
surface is durable and installation-routed — the installation id is the bot's MXID, bound to one
workspace — so ingress is the listener alone and no request is routed to it.

Most lines in a room are not addressed to the agent. A message from a member founds a turn when it
mentions the bot, when it is sent in a direct room (the bot and one other), or when the room already
holds a conversation and `ambient_reply_wanted` says the agent is wanted; anything else is heard,
kept as evidence for the next decision, and admits nothing. A sender who resolves to no member
founds nothing, however it addresses the bot; the one thing the bot reads from it is a code proving
its MXID for a member who claimed it (`linking.py`).

What a turn sends back is three handlers over one transport: `post` writes the terminal reply,
`attach` follows it with the turn's shared files, and `speak` delivers the words a turn marks before
it ends. Each relates its messages to the room message the turn answers, which admission recorded
(`answering.py`), so a reply lands as a reply and a threaded conversation stays in its thread."""
