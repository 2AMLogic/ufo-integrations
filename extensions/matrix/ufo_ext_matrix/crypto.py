"""End-to-end encryption for the bot's one device, over vodozemac's Olm and Megolm.

The device is the one the bot's access token is bound to, as `/account/whoami` names it, so a
restart keeps the device its peers already know. Its account and sessions live in the crypto store,
sealed under the `matrix_store_key` slot; with that slot empty the bot has no device keys, hears
nothing in an encrypted room, and refuses to post into one rather than posting in the clear.

Inbound, a `/sync` batch's to-device events are read first — room keys arrive there, Olm-encrypted
to this device — then each `m.room.encrypted` timeline event is decrypted into the plain event it
carries, which the surface reads exactly as it reads an unencrypted one. An event whose session key
has not arrived is parked, its key is asked for, and it is heard once the key lands; past
`PENDING_SECONDS` it is dropped with a warning. An event that will not decrypt is a dropped event
that names itself in a log, never a stopped stream. Ciphertext is never heard.

Outbound, a message into an encrypted room is Megolm-encrypted, and the session's key is first
shared over Olm with every device of every joined member that has not had it. Devices are trusted on
first use: the keys a device id first shows are pinned, and a device that later shows other keys is
neither sent keys nor believed.

A member verifies the bot's device from their own client, and the bot answers: an
`m.key.verification.*` exchange over SAS is to-device protocol from end to end, so no command, no
keyword and no endpoint carries it, and the bot never starts one. A device that finishes the
exchange is recorded verified beside its pin, which gates nothing — first use is what decides who
is sent a room key, whether a member verifies or never does.

Olm and Megolm are `vodozemac`, which the `matrix-e2ee` extra installs. This module imports without
it — every name it needs from the library is reached inside a call, and annotations are deferred
— so the surface loads and an unencrypted room is served whether the extra is there or not."""
