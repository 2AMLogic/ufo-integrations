"""Whether one room line is addressed to the bot, and so bypasses the ambient decision.

A group room is mostly people talking to each other. Four things make a line the bot's: the
intentional mention its sender's client recorded, the pill a client without intentional mentions
rendered into the HTML, the bot's own name in the words, and a reply to something the bot said. Each
matches the bot's identity whole, so `@ufobot` addresses nobody named `@ufo`.

Nothing here imports `ufo` or an HTTP client, so the contract tests hold these rules on a checkout
with neither installed."""
