"""What the matrix extension declares: one durable surface, the two credential slots its bot needs,
the setup action that binds that bot to a workspace, the skill that walks an admin through it, and
the two tools that link and unlink a member's MXID.

A Matrix room is a conversation and the people in it are members. The bot user's `/sync` stream is
the surface's listener, and each terminal turn is one message back into its room — rich text under a
relation to the message it answers — sent under a transaction id derived from the turn so a retried
delivery lands once. The turn's shared files follow that reply as messages of their own, and words
the turn marks for delivery before it ends reach the room as they are marked. The deploy names the bots
its listener runs in `UFO_MATRIX_BOTS`; each workspace holds its own bot's homeserver and token, and
`matrix_connect` binds the bot the token belongs to. A member whose MXID the workspace's domain does
not vouch for links it with `matrix_link_account` and a code sent from it; an admin undoes a link
with `matrix_unlink_account`.

Setup happens in chat and nowhere else. `matrix_connect` is an instance action bound to the `matrix`
surface, so it is offered on that one surface row — `action:surface:matrix_connect` — rather than as a
tool a turn holds everywhere, and `matrix-setup` is the skill that carries the order of the steps and
the four silences a misconfigured bot answers with.

In an encrypted room the bot's device decrypts what it is sent and encrypts what it posts; its keys
live in the extension's own table, sealed under the `matrix_store_key` slot. An edit and a redaction
found no turn."""
