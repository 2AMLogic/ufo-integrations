"""The listener and the delivery handlers against a fake homeserver: a stream resumes where it
stood, the bot's own echo and every non-message event found nothing, a declined ambient line and a
non-member's line found nothing, a room's audience only narrows, one bad event or one broken bot
holds nothing else, and every message a turn sends — its reply, its files, and the words it marks
before it ends — lands once, as rich text, under the message it answers.

A question the room answers is here too: a numbered reply and a tap on a poll arrive as the one
choice, `answerable_question` is the only gate on who may answer what, the question is rewritten once
however often its answer is delivered, and a turn that runs shows the room that it is running."""
