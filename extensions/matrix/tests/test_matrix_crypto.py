"""End-to-end encryption against a fake homeserver, with real Olm and Megolm on both ends: an
encrypted direct room round trips, a restart keeps its device and its sessions, an event that
arrives before its key is heard once the key lands and never as ciphertext, a post reaches every
member device and no departed one, a device that changes its keys is not believed, a member's client
verifies the bot's device over SAS, and the store opens only under its slot's key."""
