"""Encryption against a real homeserver: an encrypted round trip between the bot and a second
registered account, and the four answers only a homeserver can give.

`test_matrix_crypto.py` runs the same Olm and Megolm against the fake transport, and keeps the cases
a container reaches at no advantage, such as a device that changes its keys between two queries.
What it cannot answer is the homeserver's own conduct:

| Point | What the homeserver decides |
| --- | --- |
| To-device ordering | Which batch carries a room key, and whether the event it opens is in it |
| One-time key accounting | What a publish leaves it holding, and what a drawn-down pool counts |
| Fallback keys | That an emptied pool is served by the fallback key, and served again |
| `device_lists` | That a member's new device is announced to a room encrypted with them |

The module is collected only where `MATRIX_INTEGRATION_HOMESERVER` names a homeserver (see
`conftest.py`), and it needs the `matrix-e2ee` extra. It registers its own throwaway users and
creates its own encrypted room, so the target must allow registration — a private Synapse container
does. The caller, the loop runner and the writeback shape are `test_matrix_integration.py`'s; what
this module adds is a member's device that speaks Olm and Megolm over the real client-server API."""
