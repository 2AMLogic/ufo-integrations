"""A store and a tool context for pulse's own tests, built without touching the matrix extension.

The two extensions pin and activate independently (`extensions/test_distribution_pins.py`), and a
pulse test importing matrix's fakes would make that independence true of the distribution and false
of the suite. So this is pulse's own: the record's tables over an in-memory database, a context that
reaches them, and a carrier that can be present, absent, or broken — the three states the projection
has to tell apart.
