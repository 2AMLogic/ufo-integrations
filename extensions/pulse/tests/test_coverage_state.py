"""The coverage-state store, run against a temporary workspace.

A footer over several gathers is only honest if the days disagree on the record: these assert that
one source's three days aggregate as three days, that a window of one gather still reads as one run,
and that no read path writes — the moment aggregation writes anything it has started editing the
evidence it reports.
