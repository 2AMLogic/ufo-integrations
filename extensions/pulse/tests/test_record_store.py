"""The record in the tables pulse owns, and the workspace files projected from it.

The property every one of these exists for is that **the record is one record**: the same rows from
every turn in the workspace, whatever carrier ran it and whatever directory it started in. That is
what a workspace-relative file could not be, and it is why no assertion here about a row depends on
a file having landed — the file is a copy, and a carrier that cannot take one is ordinary.

(This module used to be organised around #120's claim that a carrier-less fire recorded nothing.
That claim was withdrawn: a fire records, it just recorded somewhere else. The tests were right
about what to assert and wrong about why, which is worth saying once rather than leaving a retracted
premise standing as a module's authority.)

Skipped without `ufo`, whose distribution carries sqlalchemy; the file-shaped contract tests beside
this one still run on a checkout that has neither.
