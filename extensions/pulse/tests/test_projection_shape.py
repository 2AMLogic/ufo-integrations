"""The projection is the file the scripts wrote, byte for byte.

`record.py` restates the shapes the skill scripts own — the slug pattern, the three date patterns,
and coverage's three states with their four reasons — because a skill script is materialised
standalone in a sandbox and cannot import the extension package. Restating is not the risk;
restating *and then drifting* is, because the drift would be silent: a store that accepted a slug
the script rejects writes a line the script cannot read back, and the member's file and the agent's
record would disagree about what the series holds.

So these read the scripts' own source and behaviour rather than trusting the duplication. They are
the reason `record.py` may say "the row shapes are the file's, unchanged" in its docstring.

Skipped without sqlalchemy, which is `record.py`'s only import beyond the standard library.
