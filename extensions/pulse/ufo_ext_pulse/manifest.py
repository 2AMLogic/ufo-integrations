"""What the pulse extension declares: the agent a pulse runs as, five skills it loads on demand, and
the four calls that keep a series' record alive when nobody is watching.

A recurring field brief is a series, not a report. `pulse-handoff` recognises the ask in the
member's own conversation and hands it to the `pulse` agent; `field-pulse` runs the setup there,
writes the first brief and arms a daily gather; `field-report` writes every edition after it, from
the pool those gathers filled and without a search in the request path; `brief-continuity` holds the
covered ledger that makes the next brief carry what the last one did not, and the sightings pool the
report reads; `coverage-honesty` keeps a window nobody could read from being published as a window
where nothing happened.

**The agent is why the handoff exists.** `scheduled_tasks` writes a row's `agent_id` from the turn
that applied it and its manifest `spec` names no agent, so a gather is owned by whoever set the
pulse up. Setting one up from a chat turn arms a daily search that runs as the assistant; setting
one up from a `pulse` turn arms one that runs as `pulse`. `agent.py` holds the row and the reasons;
the handoff is the one turn that reaches it.

**The store is this extension's own, and that is the whole of why it owns tools and a job.** The
ledger, the pool and the coverage state began as workspace files at a workspace-relative path, which
resolves against the directory the turn's carrier started in — the member's own machine for a
conversation bound to a terminal, `workspace_root/<conversation_id>` for one that is not. One series
therefore grew one ledger per tree.
On the demo deploy the `agent-runtimes` series had two of them, 15 rows each, whose 2026-09-28
editions shared no story at all — and the no-repeat rule was enforced against whichever half the
running carrier could see. The rows now land in tables keyed by workspace and series, which every
turn reaches identically.

The file stays, because a member can open a file and cannot open a table — but as a projection
written by `jobs.py`, not by the tools. A tool could write one, through `ctx.sandbox.write_file`;
what it could not do is put the copy in the series' own conversation rather than its own turn's, or
render a record that advanced while no workspace could take a file. `jobs.py` says why at length.

Gathering is still `research`'s, the recurring row still `scheduled_tasks`', and the feed entry
still `report_digest`'s. `requires` names the one seam a brief cannot be written without: a deploy
with pulse active and no search backend fails at boot rather than on the first fire."""
