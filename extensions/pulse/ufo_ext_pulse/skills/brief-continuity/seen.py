"""The sightings pool: what a gather has seen, separately from what an edition published.

One JSON Lines file per series at `pulse/<series>.seen.jsonl` in the conversation workspace,
append-only, one row per sighting. `record` appends a sighting; `history` reads every sighting of one
lead; `fresh` lists the leads worth pursuing now; `stale` answers whether one lead has gone quiet.

Two stores, two questions. The covered ledger answers *what has been published* and governs what an
edition may repeat. This answers *what has been seen* and governs what is worth chasing. Merging them
would lose both answers: a lead seen four times and never published is not a repeat, and a story
published once is not a lead.

Rows sharing a slug are that lead's history, exactly as they are in the covered ledger. A story seen
on Tuesday and again on Wednesday in a changed state is two rows rather than an overwrite, and the
difference between them is the evidence a material new development needs.

Nothing is ever removed. Collection is additive: a lead that goes quiet for three weeks and then
moves is still here with its whole history attached, which a pool that expired it would have
discarded at exactly the moment it became interesting. Age is a reason not to pursue a lead, never a
reason to forget it — so staleness is asked at read time, here, rather than enforced by deletion.

Staleness keys on the *most recent* sighting. A lead first seen thirty days ago and seen again this
morning is live, not old; asking how long ago it first appeared answers a different question than
whether it is still moving.

The path is workspace-relative for the same reason the covered ledger's is: only a command's argv is
rewritten to the carrier's workspace directory, never a path inside a script.

    A slug is a judgement made inside one run, and two runs looking at one story need not reach the
    same judgement. Nothing in `record` can catch that — the slug is the caller's to choose and only
    its shape is checked. The url is chosen outside the run, which makes it the better key and not a
    sound one.

    **One url under several slugs has two causes and this cannot separate them.** Either a story was
    renamed between sightings, which is the trap the skill already names — or the url names a page
    rather than a story, a blog index or a repository root, and the slugs are different stories that
    happened to be found at one address. Both look identical here. Reporting the first alone would
    be a verdict the data does not carry, so both are named and neither is chosen.

    One slug over several urls is the quieter direction: two stories filed as one lead, the second
    hidden behind the first's history.

    What it stays silent about is not thereby clean. A story syndicated at three addresses is three
    urls and reads as three leads, and no comparison of urls will say otherwise.

    Urls are stripped as they are read, and a row whose url is blank once stripped is skipped. This
    reader is the one consumer that cannot trust the writer: rows predate the guard that requires a
    url, and the guard that preceded it tested `url.strip()` while storing `url` raw. So a padded
    legacy row and a clean one naming one story would read as two urls, and a whitespace-only url
    would group with every other whitespace-only url — both reported as findings, with a diagnosis
    attached to each, on exactly the old rows this exists to audit."""
