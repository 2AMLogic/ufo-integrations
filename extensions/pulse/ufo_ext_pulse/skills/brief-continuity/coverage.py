"""Coverage state: what each source returned on each gather, and what a window of them adds up to.

One JSON Lines file per series at `pulse/<series>.coverage.jsonl` in the conversation workspace,
append-only, one row per source per gather. `record` appends one source's state as its read returns;
`window` aggregates every source's states across the gathers a report covers.

`coverage-honesty` gives a source three states in one run, and a footer written from one gather says
which of them it was. A report covering three gathers holds three sets of those states, and a flat
"not read: the filings index" over them is ambiguous: unread on one day and unread on all three are
different claims about the field, and the reader acts on them differently. Telling them apart needs
each source's state on each gather, rather than the last state to be written.

Three stores, three questions. The covered ledger answers what a series has published, the sightings
pool answers what a gather has seen, and this answers what a gather could read. Its subject is a
source rather than a story, so it carries no slug for a lead: a story nobody saw and a source nobody
could reach are different facts, and one store holding both would answer neither.

The source slug is that source's durable address across gathers, the way a story slug is across
editions. The footer names the source in the reader's words; the store keys it by the slug, which is
what lets three days of one source aggregate as one source.

Nothing is ever removed, for the same reason the pool removes nothing: a gather's states are an
observation of that day, and that stays true afterwards. A retry inside one gather appends its own
row rather than repairing the earlier one, and the read resolves the two — the later row is that
gather's answer, because a source that rate-limited the first attempt and answered the second was
read that day.

The path is workspace-relative, the way the ledger's and the pool's are: only a command's argv is
rewritten to the carrier's workspace directory, never a path inside a script.
