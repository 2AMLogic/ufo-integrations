"""The projection: the member-readable copy of a series' record, written by a job.

**Why a job and not the tool that recorded the row.** A workspace file is written through
`ExtensionContext.files`, and that seam is only wired where core passes `sandboxes=` when it builds
the context — `serve.py` does so for the job runner, the page-change runner and surface contexts, and
`host/ext/loader.py`'s `turn_tools` does not. So `ctx.ext.files` is `None` in *every* extension tool
handler, unconditionally. A projection attempted there is not unreliable; it is dead code that
reports "no carrier" on a deploy where every carrier is present.

**Why it wakes on work rather than on the clock.** `ConversationFiles.write` opens a sandbox rather
than reusing a live one, so a job that rendered every series each tick would start a container per
pulse conversation per tick to rewrite files nothing had changed. `due_projections` is the select
`owner_candidates` runs instead: a workspace with no series past its projection mark is never bound,
and a series is rendered once per advance rather than once per tick.

**What a failure means here.** The record is already durable when this runs — the rows were
committed by the tool that wrote them. A conversation whose sandbox cannot be opened therefore costs
a stale copy of a file, never a lost row, and the right response is to leave the mark unmoved and
let the next tick try again. So one series' failure is logged and skipped rather than raised, which
would abandon every series after it in the same workspace.

This is an ordinary state rather than an alarm: a terminal-bound conversation takes a file only
while that terminal is connected, so a brief whose member has closed their session stays due until
they open one. That is why the failure is logged per series and the series left due, and why nothing
here escalates on a run of them.
