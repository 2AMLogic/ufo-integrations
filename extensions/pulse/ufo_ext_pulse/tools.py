"""The three calls that keep a brief series' record in one place.

Two write, one reads. They exist because the record used to be a file at a workspace-relative path,
which resolves against whatever directory the turn's carrier started in: a conversation bound to a
terminal (`sandbox_handle` of `client:<cwd>`) writes on the member's machine in that directory,
and any other conversation writes under `workspace_root/<conversation_id>`. One series therefore
grew one ledger per tree, each looking complete and none of them whole. These write to tables
instead, keyed by workspace and series, which every turn in the workspace reaches identically.

**Nothing here writes a file.** `ExtensionContext.files` is `None` in every extension tool handler —
core wires that seam for the job runner and for surface contexts, and `turn_tools` does not wire it
at all — so a projection attempted here would be dead code that reported "no carrier" on a deploy
where every carrier is present. `jobs.py` owns the workspace-file copy, as a job, for that reason.

What each write does do is stamp the series row with the conversation it ran in and the moment it
advanced, in the same transaction as the rows. That is what the projection job selects on, so a
committed write always has a projection due behind it and a rolled-back one never does.
